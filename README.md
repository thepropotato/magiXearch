# What is MagiXearch ? 

**MagiXearch** is an AI powered image storage cloud. Just like google photos, but revolutionary. Google photos allows users to store images by uploading. This application generates descriptions for selected images during the time of upload. We using magixearch, allow the users not only to upload images, but also to check the generated descriptions and edit them if not satisfied.
